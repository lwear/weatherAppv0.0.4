# Web Dev Weather App 0.0.4

This is a weather app that loads dynamic weather data in json format for Victoria BC.  

* Use responsive design, so it works on desktop or mobile.
* Is the second of many stages towards building your first Progressive Web App (PWA).

The app is based on the Google Code Lab https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/#0, but has been modified to match the learning outcomes of Web Development 11/12 at Mount Douglas Secondary.
